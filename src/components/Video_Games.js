					SPOILER ALERT

(If you find yourself lost and don’t have the time to ponder the cube to get your keys back)

 

Solution path through Cubeland:

Door directions to take

D, R, D, U, O, U, R, L, D, I, L, U, L, D, I, U, L, R, R, I, D, O, D, U, R, I, R, D, O, O, R, O, R 

 

Cubeland is 27 rooms connected together like the vertices of a cube.

If you travel to the edge of the cube in whichever direction, you will emerge at the opposite side room of the cube. For instance, if you were in the middle furthest to the left room of the cube and went through the left door, you would enter the room in the middle furthest to the right room of the cube. The same logic applies for up/down and in/out

In/out doors (in in the right middle of the rooms, out in the left middle of the rooms) move you in the z direction of the cube.

 

The player's position in the cube is represented by a map at the top left corner of the screen and as the background of each room.
